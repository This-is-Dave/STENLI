# STENLI

STENLI is a financial planner application for students (especially college students) who
where the contents of the Stenli application are:

1. Calculating Monthly Expenditure.
2. Determine User Emergency Fund.
3. Recommend Estimated User Monthly Spending Limit.
4. Determine How Long to Save for something the user wants.

This application is still under development and of course, requires a lot of changes.
